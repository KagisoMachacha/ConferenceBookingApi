AI Usage Report

1.How I used AI tools during this assessment

I used AI tools to support the development of my Conference Booking API by helping me understand errors, 
redefine validation logic, and clarify certain C# and Entity Framework Core concepts. 
AI assisted mainly as a debugging partner and a reference tool for best-practice patterns, 
while I handled all architectural decisions, coding, and final implementation.

2.Most effective prompts/questions

The prompts that worked best were those where I provided:
 - A specific code snippet that was failing
 - The exact error message
 - A clear description of the expected behaviour

Examples include:
 - “Show me how to fix this DateTimeOffset vs DateTime mismatch.”
 - “Help me implement structured error handling for this validation.”
 - “Why does this LINQ query still insert records when the validation fails?”
 - These produced actionable fixes instead of generic suggestions.


3.What I validated or modified from AI suggestions

I always verified suggestions by:
 - Testing them directly in the API
 - Checking if they aligned with REST design principles
 - Ensuring the solution matched .NET and Entity Framework Core best practices

Some AI recommendations needed adjustment, for example:
 - Suggestions about completely changing the model types weren’t appropriate, so I instead updated the service logic only.
 - For error handling, I refined the structure to match the assessment’s expected format.
 - I validated that the logic prevented invalid bookings before DB save operations.


4.Challenges AI helped solve vs. where I relied on my own expertise

AI helped with:
 - Understanding compiler errors
 - Fixing incorrect validation paths
 - LINQ query corrections
 - Deciding when to use checks like AnyAsync() vs direct lookups
 - Clarifying EF Core navigation properties
 - Improving readability and consistency in the service layer

I relied on my own expertise for:
 - Designing the architecture of the application
 - Deciding how entities relate (Room, Booking, RoomAmenity, etc.)
 - Applying business rules like “no booking after 17:00”
 - Writing the final logic flow for create/update operations
 - Ensuring security, correctness, and adherence to the requirements


5.Did AI help with database design? How I verified correctness

AI helped mostly by explaining EF Core behaviours such as how navigation properties work and when to use RoomId vs Room. However,
the actual design decisions (tables, foreign keys, and modelling) were done using my own reasoning and based on the problem requirements.

I verified correctness by:
 - Reviewing EF Core migration outputs
 - Checking the generated relationships in the database
 - Testing CRUD operations against the final schema
 - Ensuring referential integrity (e.g., Room must exist before a Booking is created)
